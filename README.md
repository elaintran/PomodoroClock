# PomodoroClock
<p>The Pomodoro Timer utilizes the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that breaks down a task into short, timed intervals, separated by small breaks. These intervals, also known as pomodoros, are usually 25 minutes in length. The timer sports a simplistic user interface and focuses on visual cues to distinguish between work and break sessions.</p>
