# PomodoroClock
<p>The Pomodoro Timer utilizes the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that breaks down a task into short, timed intervals, separated by small breaks. These intervals, also known as pomodoros, are usually 25 minutes in length. The timer sports a simplistic user interface and focuses on visual cues to distinguish between work and break sessions.</p>

## USER STORIES
<p>One of freeCodeCampâ€™s intermediate front end projects is to create a pomodoro clock with the following user stories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.</li>
  <li>I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.</li>
  <li>I can customize the length of each pomodoro.</li>
</ul>
